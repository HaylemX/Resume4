      <li>I started coding a few days ago and instantly grew a passion for coding and felt that this career change was something I've always wanted to do. I love the problem-solving experience, competitiveness and mainly the creativty when it comes to coding. I have tons of friends who currently work at major techs and I've always admired their lifestyle and careers. I absolutely LOVE language and I truly believe this career was always meant for me!

      <li>Me and my SO are VERY eager to start coding at Prime-Academy and can't wait to furthur our career paths!
